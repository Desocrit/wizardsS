# wizardsS

The current working build of the Wizards S project. 
To run, simply download the .swf file, and open it with any web browser with an up-to-date version of flash.

Controls:

Standard movement controls are WASD, and missiles are fired by pressing (or holding) the left mouse button. Use the + or – keys to spawn (or stop spawning) enemies (note that missiles will ‘whiff’ if no targets are available). Hold Shift to see the controls for the other attacks. Finally, click the “Upgrades” button at the bottom of the screen (it will auto-hide when the mouse is not hovering over it, though it flashes and changes to “Level Up” after a few enemies are killed) to adjust attacks, spells, and upgrades, as well as see detailed descriptions of each of the available elements. 

Note that every square icon on the upgrade screen can be clicked to customise your character, and every spell, rune and element is fully implemented. Be aware that there is currently a bug that the game occasionally does not correctly un-pause when the upgrade screen is closed, and must be restarted.


Tips

The enemies with shields (that look a bit like duck bills) take triple damage from behind. Try to curve your attacks around them. In this build, the cooldown for Turret is reduced from 30 seconds to 2 seconds, so you can have a lot of fun abusing elemental effects (the turret benefits from any elemental upgrades, and uses the same elemental type as you do unless the Chaos Gem is selected). 

If you click around the Upgrade screen, you’ll probably see that there are huge amounts of upgrades and spells to play with. My personal favourites include the Thunderstorm, Tornado, Black Hole and Reactive, Leaping, Smog and Limit Breaker gems for elements, the Gem of Rogue Magic ultimate gem, the Bull Rush and Double Up gems for Propel, and the Gem of Chaos for Turret.
